Multiple concepts and applications have been explored.

1) Bisection method, False position method, Fixed point iteration method, Newton Raphson method and Secant method to find the root of of f(x)=xcos(x)-10sin(x**2/10)

2) Cholesky decomposition of a (N × N) symmetric matrix.

3) Newton-Raphson method and Gauss Seidel method for a system of non-linear equations

4) Solving Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model using i) Fehlberg, ii) Cash-Karp and iii) Dormand–Prince Methods.

5) solving ODEs based on 4th order accurate Gear Open and Gear Closed multistep formulation

6) Euler backward Thomas Algorithm for Parabolic ODEs

7) Jacobi-Seidel, Gauss-Seidel and SOR Methods for Finite Difference Equations with Boundary Conditions
